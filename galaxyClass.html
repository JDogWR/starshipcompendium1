                    The Enterprise-D is the ship from the very popular Star Trek: The Next Generation television series. It is a Galaxy-Class starship with over 1,000 people on board. It was the first time that Starfleet experimented with putting families on board starships. It was similar to a luxury cruise liner, but it also had the most advanced systems that Starfleet had to offer. From labs to weapons to swimming pools, this ship truly had it all. It even included the new holodecks. The Enterprise-D was launched on October 4, 2363 as the Federationâ€™s flagship under the command of veteran Captain Jean-Luc Picard (played by Sir Patrick Stewart). This ship would go on to have 7 years of adventures before being destroyed by Klingons in the feature film Star Trek: Generations. From making first contact with the Q to being involved in the First Battle of Sector 001, the USS Enterprise-D launched Star Trek into a new age.
